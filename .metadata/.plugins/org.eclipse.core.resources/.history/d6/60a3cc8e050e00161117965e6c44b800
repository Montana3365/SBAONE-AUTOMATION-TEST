Am I Eligible?
Based on your answers, you may be eligible for:
Women-Owned Small Business

Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business
The NAICS code entered does not appear on the list of designated industries in which WOSB Program set-asides are authorized. As such, be advised that federal contracts currently cannot be set-aside under the WOSB Program in this industry. However, this does not preclude you from certifying as a WOSB or EDWOSB if you meet the requirements of the WOSB Program.
