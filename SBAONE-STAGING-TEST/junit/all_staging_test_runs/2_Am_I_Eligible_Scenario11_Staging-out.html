The NAICS code entered does not appear on the list of designated industries in which WOSB Program set-asides are authorized. As such, be advised that federal contracts currently cannot be set-aside under the WOSB Program in this industry. However, this does not preclude you from certifying as a WOSB or EDWOSB if you meet the requirements of the WOSB Program.
For more information, please contact the SBAWOSB Program Office or the SBASBA Women's Business Center
